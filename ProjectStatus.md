# Project Status: WellnessWave Frontend Development

## Work Log - Doctor Image Proximity Effect (Update)

### Implemented Features
- Repositioned the doctor image to the top-left of the `.tips-main` section using `position: absolute`.
- Adjusted `z-index` to `0` to place the image behind the main container's content (like the tip cards).
- Updated `transform-origin` to `top left` for correct scaling from the new position.
- Added opacity to the image container for a subtle appearance.
- Updated JavaScript proximity logic to include a visibility check, optimizing performance by skipping calculations when the image is off-screen.

### Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. **Issue**: Image initially appeared *over* the tip cards due to fixed positioning and higher z-index.
   **Solution**: Changed `position` to `absolute` (relative to `.tips-main`), set `z-index` to `0`, and ensured `.tips-main .container` has `position: relative` and `z-index: 1`.

2. **Issue**: Proximity effect calculations running even when the image wasn't visible.
   **Solution**: Added a check using `getBoundingClientRect()` in the `mousemove` listener to see if the image is outside the viewport bounds (plus the threshold) and skip calculations if it is.

### Execution Status
✅ **Successful Implementation**: The doctor image is now positioned at the top-left, behind the main content, and the proximity effect functions correctly, including the performance optimization for visibility.

### Technical Details
- CSS `position: absolute` used for positioning within the parent section.
- `z-index: 0` on the image container and `z-index: 1` on the `.tips-main .container` ensures correct layering.
- JavaScript `getBoundingClientRect()` check added to `mousemove` listener for optimization.

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding a subtle rotation or tilt effect along with the scaling.
- Explore different easing functions for the animation.
- Implement a more specific trigger area instead of the entire document for the `mouseleave` reset.
- Make the image clickable, perhaps linking to a contact or about section.

## Work Log - Doctor Image Proximity Effect (Initial)

### Implemented Features
- Added doctor.png image to the tips page
- Positioned the image using CSS (initially fixed, bottom-right)
- Implemented a JavaScript proximity effect using GSAP:
  - The image smoothly scales up as the mouse cursor gets closer
  - The scaling effect reaches its maximum when the cursor is very close
  - The image smoothly returns to its original size when the mouse moves away
- Added responsive adjustments to hide the image on smaller screens

### Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. **Issue**: Initial CSS hover effect wasn't meeting the "proximity" requirement.
   **Solution**: Implemented a JavaScript solution using GSAP to calculate mouse distance and dynamically apply scaling.

2. **Issue**: Potential performance concerns with mousemove event listeners.
   **Solution**: Used GSAP's optimized animation handling and `overwrite: 'auto'` to manage animations efficiently. Kept calculations within the event listener lightweight.

3. **Issue**: Image could potentially overlap important content on smaller screens.
   **Solution**: Added media queries to hide the image container below 768px viewport width.

### Execution Status
✅ **Successful Implementation**: The doctor image has been added to the tips page, and the proximity scaling effect is functioning smoothly using GSAP. The image scales based on mouse distance as intended, and it is hidden on smaller screens to maintain a clean layout.

### Technical Details
- Used `getBoundingClientRect()` to get the image's position.
- Calculated Euclidean distance between mouse cursor and image center.
- Mapped the distance to a scale factor using linear interpolation.
- Used `gsap.to()` for smooth animation of the `scale` property.
- Added `mouseleave` event listener on the document to reset the scale when the mouse leaves the window.

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding a subtle rotation or tilt effect along with the scaling.
- Explore different easing functions for the animation.
- Implement a more specific trigger area instead of the entire document for the `mouseleave` reset.
- Make the image clickable, perhaps linking to a contact or about section.

## Work Log - Authentication Implementation in Tips Page

### Implemented Features
- Added authentication functionality to the tips page to match other pages
- Implemented login/logout button toggle based on authentication status
- Ensured consistent user experience across all site pages
- Added jQuery dependency for auth-ui.js functionality
- Included necessary CSS styles for authentication-related elements

### Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. **Issue**: The tips.html page was missing jQuery which is required by auth-ui.js.
   **Solution**: Added the jQuery library via CDN to ensure auth-ui.js works properly.

2. **Issue**: Missing logout button in the navigation bar.
   **Solution**: Added a logout button with appropriate classes (btn-secondary, logout-btn, hidden).

3. **Issue**: Missing CSS classes for authentication styling.
   **Solution**: Added the necessary CSS classes (.hidden, .logged-in, .logout-btn) to tips.css.

### Execution Status
✅ **Successful Implementation**: The authentication functionality has been successfully implemented in the tips page. The login button now changes to the user's last name after successful login, and a logout button appears. The functionality is consistent with the other pages of the site.

### Technical Details
- Used the existing auth-ui.js script for authentication management
- Implemented consistent class naming across all pages
- Ensured proper hiding/showing of elements based on login status
- Maintained consistent styling for login/logout buttons

## Work Log - Frosted Glass Effect for Tip Cards

### Implemented Features
- Added a modern frosted glass effect to the tip cards using CSS backdrop-filter
- Enhanced the visual appeal with subtle gradients and improved shadows
- Updated the tips-main section background with a light gradient and subtle pattern
- Improved typography and spacing for better readability
- Enhanced the "Read More" button with a more modern, interactive design
- Added smooth animations for hover states to improve user interaction

### Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. **Issue**: There was a potential compatibility concern with backdrop-filter in older browsers.
   **Solution**: Added -webkit-backdrop-filter vendor prefix for better cross-browser support and created a fallback appearance using background color and opacity.

2. **Issue**: The frosted glass effect needed appropriate background contrast to be visible.
   **Solution**: Added a gradient background to the tips-main section to enhance the glass effect visibility.

3. **Issue**: The text on frosted glass cards needed contrast improvements for accessibility.
   **Solution**: Adjusted text colors and font weights to ensure proper contrast ratios and readability.

### Execution Status
✅ **Successful Implementation**: The frosted glass effect has been successfully implemented on the tip cards, creating a modern and visually appealing interface. The new design enhances the content visibility while providing an elegant, contemporary aesthetic.

### Technical Details
- Used CSS backdrop-filter property for the glass effect
- Implemented multiple layers with pseudo-elements to create depth
- Applied cubic-bezier timing functions for smoother animations
- Used SVG background patterns for subtle texture
- Incorporated gradient effects for buttons and backgrounds
- Enhanced accessibility by maintaining proper contrast ratios

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding subtle animation when cards initially load
- Explore using CSS variables for easier theming
- Add support for reduced motion preferences for accessibility
- Consider implementing card color variations based on the tip category

## Work Log - Tip Card Modal Implementation

### Implemented Features
- Created a modal overlay system for the tip cards
- Added a morphing animation effect that transitions from the tip card to the modal
- Implemented JavaScript functionality for opening and closing the modal
- Styled the modal with a clean, modern design using the site's color scheme
- Added detailed content for each tip type (Cardiovascular Health, Mental Wellness, etc.)
- Ensured responsive design for all screen sizes
- Implemented accessibility features (keyboard navigation, aria attributes)

### Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. **Issue**: Initial challenge with positioning the modal to match the clicked card position
   **Solution**: Used getBoundingClientRect() to get the exact card position and used GSAP to set initial modal position.

2. **Issue**: Modal content scrolling issues on mobile devices
   **Solution**: Added the 'active' class after animation completes to enable scrolling only when animation is done.

3. **Issue**: Card hover effects interfering with the morphing animation
   **Solution**: Added a 'no-hover-effect' class to prevent hover styling during animation.

4. **Issue**: Need for different content for each tip type
   **Solution**: Created a tipContent object in JavaScript to store and dynamically load content based on the tip title.

### Execution Status
✅ **Successful Implementation**: The tip card modal feature has been successfully implemented with all planned functionality. The morphing animation creates a smooth transition between the tip card and the detailed modal view, enhancing user experience.

### Technical Details
- Used GSAP for animations to ensure smooth performance across devices
- Implemented event delegation for better performance with multiple tip cards
- Added keyboard event listeners for accessibility (Escape key closes the modal)
- Used CSS transitions combined with GSAP for optimal animation performance
- Structured modal content for consistent presentation across different tip types

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding pagination for very long content
- Add social sharing functionality for tips
- Implement a "save to favorites" feature for logged-in users

  ```
- Created flexible CORS configuration that supports both development and production environments:
  ```javascript
  app.use(cors({
      origin: function(origin, callback) {
          // Dynamic CORS check against config.allowedOrigins
          // Including regex pattern matching for Azure domains
      },
      methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
      credentials: true
  }));
  ```
- Updated data paths to use configuration values:
  ```javascript
  const dataDir = path.resolve(config.dataPath);
  const usersFilePath = path.join(dataDir, 'users.json');
  
  // Ensure data directory exists
  if (!fs.existsSync(dataDir)) {
      fs.mkdirSync(dataDir, { recursive: true });
  }
  ```

## YYYY-MM-DD: Adjust Recipe Grid Layout

### Functions Implemented:
- Modified the CSS for `.recipes-grid` to use `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);`.

### Errors Encountered:
- None.

### Solutions:
- Changed the CSS grid definition to enforce exactly three columns per row. The filter section's width alignment is handled by the shared parent container (`.main-container`).

### Status:
- Implementation successful. Recipe cards should now consistently display three per row, and the filter section should align with their total width.

## YYYY-MM-DD: Increase Main Container Width

### Functions Implemented:
- Increased the `max-width` of the `.main-container` from `1200px` to `1320px` in `css/meal-planner.css`.

### Errors Encountered:
- None.

### Solutions:
- Widened the main container to allow the three recipe cards within the grid to expand proportionally, effectively increasing their width by approximately 10%.

### Status:
- Implementation successful. The overall content area, including the filter section and the recipe grid, is now wider.

## YYYY-MM-DD: Fix Footer Container Width

### Functions Implemented:
- Added specific `.footer .container` CSS rule with `width: 90%` and `max-width: 1040px` to match the index.html page.

### Errors Encountered:
- Footer width inconsistency between meal-planner.html and index.html, causing the content to span wider in meal-planner (1092px vs 1038px).

### Solutions:
- Added explicit width constraints for the footer container to ensure consistent layout and visual appearance across pages.
- Used DevTools measurements to accurately match the widths.

### Status:
- Implementation successful. The footer container in meal-planner.html should now match the width in index.html, ensuring UI consistency.

## YYYY-MM-DD: Implement Saved Recipes with localStorage

### Functions Implemented:
- Added localStorage integration to save and retrieve user's saved recipes
- Created a heart button with counter in the filter section showing number of saved recipes
- Implemented a modal/pop-out screen to display saved recipes with the same card design as the main grid
- Added the ability to unsave recipes from the saved recipes modal

### Errors Encountered:
- None

### Solutions:
- Used localStorage API to persist saved recipes between user sessions
- Created a modal system that maintains the same card design/layout as the main recipe grid
- Added an unsave functionality that removes recipes from localStorage and updates the counter

### Status:
- Implementation successful. Users can now save recipes, view them in a pop-out modal, and the saved recipes persist between sessions.

## [Date - e.g., YYYY-MM-DD]

**Task:** Implement Scroll-to-Top Button in meal-planner.html

**Functions Implemented:**
- Added HTML structure for the scroll-to-top button (`#scrollToTopBtn`) in `meal-planner.html`.
- Added CSS styles for positioning, appearance (oval shape, icon treatment), visibility transition, and responsiveness for `.scroll-to-top-btn` in `css/meal-planner.css`.
- Implemented JavaScript logic (`setupScrollToTop` function in `js/meal-planner.js`):
  - Detects scroll position relative to `#recipesGrid`.
  - Toggles visibility of `#scrollToTopBtn` with a fade/slide effect.
  - Handles click event on the button to scroll smoothly to `#main-container`.

**Errors Encountered:** None.

**Error Solutions:** N/A.

## Project Status Log

## Navbar Animation Fix (index.html & meal-planner.html)

- **Implemented Function:** Added consistent navbar hide/show animation (smooth fade and slide) on scroll to `index.html` and `meal-planner.html`, matching the behavior in `tips.html`.
- **Errors Encountered:**
    1.  The navbar animation logic in `js/main.js` was initially outside the `DOMContentLoaded` listener, potentially executing before the navbar element was ready.
    2.  jQuery's `.show()` and `.hide()` methods used in `js/auth-ui.js` were directly manipulating the `display` style, interfering with the CSS `opacity` transition on the navbar and its children, causing the fade effect to fail.
- **Error Solution:**
    1.  Moved the navbar scroll event listener code block inside the `DOMContentLoaded` listener in `js/main.js`.
    2.  Replaced all instances of `.show()` and `.hide()` in `js/auth-ui.js` with `.removeClass('hidden')` and `.addClass('hidden')` respectively to leverage CSS transitions properly.
- **Execution Status:** Successful. The necessary CSS transitions were already present. Both JavaScript timing and interference issues have been addressed.

## Login Button Visibility Fix

- **Implemented Function:** Ensured the "Login In" button in the navbar (on `index.html` and `meal-planner.html`) and the "Join Today" side button (on `index.html`) are hidden when a user is logged in.
- **Errors Encountered:** The buttons were missing the `hide-when-logged-in` CSS class, preventing the existing `js/auth-ui.js` logic from hiding them.
- **Error Solution:** Added the `hide-when-logged-in` class to the respective anchor tags (`<a>`) in `index.html` and `meal-planner.html`.
- **Execution Status:** Successful. The buttons should now be correctly hidden upon successful login.

## Navbar Animation Fix (GSAP Approach)

- **Implemented Function:** Refactored the navbar hide/show animation on scroll for `
