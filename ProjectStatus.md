# Project Status - Frontend Sport

This file tracks the progress, challenges, and solutions implemented throughout the development of the Frontend Sport project.

## 2023-11-26: Video Path Fix in Meal Planner Hero Section

### Functions Implemented:
- Fixed video source path to correctly reference the video file in the root directory
- Corrected overlay div class name to match CSS styling
- Simplified video element markup for better cross-browser compatibility

### Errors Encountered:
- Video resource failed to load with error: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
- The video file exists in the root directory but was incorrectly referenced in a subdirectory

### Solutions:
- Updated video source path to point directly to the file in the root directory
- Removed unnecessary fallback video source
- Fixed class naming inconsistency from "overlay" to "hero-overlay"

### Status:
- Implementation successful - video now loads properly from the correct path
- Hero section displays correctly with proper overlay and video background
- Parallax scrolling effects work as expected

## 2023-11-25: Hero Video Implementation

### Functions Implemented:
- Added a video background to the meal planner hero section with parallax effects
- Created meal-planner-hero.js for handling scroll animations and parallax effects
- Enhanced CSS styles for the hero section with improved transitions and animations
- Added a scroll down arrow with animation for better UX

### Errors Encountered:
- No significant errors were encountered during implementation
- Added fallback video source in case the local meal-video.mp4 file isn't available

### Solutions:
- Used GSAP and ScrollTrigger for smooth parallax animations
- Implemented responsive design for the hero section
- Added proper null checks in JavaScript to prevent potential errors

### Status:
- Implementation successful - hero section now features a video background with parallax scrolling effect
- Next steps: Continue enhancing meal planner functionality and recipe filtering system

## Previous Implementation: Meal Planner CORS Solution

### Functions Implemented:
- Implemented Solution 2 for handling recipe data by embedding JSON directly in JavaScript
- Created responsive meal planner interface with recipe filtering system
- Implemented 3D flip card animations for recipe details

### Errors Encountered:
- CORS issues when trying to fetch local JSON data

### Solutions:
- Embedded JSON data directly in JavaScript instead of fetching from external file
- Updated state management to work with embedded data
- Documented solution in README and Lesson.md

### Status:
- Implementation successful - meal planner now functions correctly without CORS errors

## YYYY-MM-DD: Adjust Recipe Grid Layout

### Functions Implemented:
- Modified the CSS for `.recipes-grid` to use `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);`.

### Errors Encountered:
- None.

### Solutions:
- Changed the CSS grid definition to enforce exactly three columns per row. The filter section's width alignment is handled by the shared parent container (`.main-container`).

### Status:
- Implementation successful. Recipe cards should now consistently display three per row, and the filter section should align with their total width.

## YYYY-MM-DD: Increase Main Container Width

### Functions Implemented:
- Increased the `max-width` of the `.main-container` from `1200px` to `1320px` in `css/meal-planner.css`.

### Errors Encountered:
- None.

### Solutions:
- Widened the main container to allow the three recipe cards within the grid to expand proportionally, effectively increasing their width by approximately 10%.

### Status:
- Implementation successful. The overall content area, including the filter section and the recipe grid, is now wider.

## YYYY-MM-DD: Fix Footer Container Width

### Functions Implemented:
- Added specific `.footer .container` CSS rule with `width: 90%` and `max-width: 1040px` to match the index.html page.

### Errors Encountered:
- Footer width inconsistency between meal-planner.html and index.html, causing the content to span wider in meal-planner (1092px vs 1038px).

### Solutions:
- Added explicit width constraints for the footer container to ensure consistent layout and visual appearance across pages.
- Used DevTools measurements to accurately match the widths.

### Status:
- Implementation successful. The footer container in meal-planner.html should now match the width in index.html, ensuring UI consistency.

## YYYY-MM-DD: Implement Saved Recipes with localStorage

### Functions Implemented:
- Added localStorage integration to save and retrieve user's saved recipes
- Created a heart button with counter in the filter section showing number of saved recipes
- Implemented a modal/pop-out screen to display saved recipes with the same card design as the main grid
- Added the ability to unsave recipes from the saved recipes modal

### Errors Encountered:
- None

### Solutions:
- Used localStorage API to persist saved recipes between user sessions
- Created a modal system that maintains the same card design/layout as the main recipe grid
- Added an unsave functionality that removes recipes from localStorage and updates the counter

### Status:
- Implementation successful. Users can now save recipes, view them in a pop-out modal, and the saved recipes persist between sessions.

## [Date - e.g., YYYY-MM-DD]

**Task:** Implement Scroll-to-Top Button in meal-planner.html

**Functions Implemented:**
- Added HTML structure for the scroll-to-top button (`#scrollToTopBtn`) in `meal-planner.html`.
- Added CSS styles for positioning, appearance (oval shape, icon treatment), visibility transition, and responsiveness for `.scroll-to-top-btn` in `css/meal-planner.css`.
- Implemented JavaScript logic (`setupScrollToTop` function in `js/meal-planner.js`):
  - Detects scroll position relative to `#recipesGrid`.
  - Toggles visibility of `#scrollToTopBtn` with a fade/slide effect.
  - Handles click event on the button to scroll smoothly to `#main-container`.

**Errors Encountered:** None.

**Error Solutions:** N/A.

**Execution Success:** Successful. The button appears/disappears based on scroll position and scrolls to the target element on click.
