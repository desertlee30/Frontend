## Work Log - Fitness Page Hero Background Image Fix

### Implemented Features
- Fixed the hero background image display on the fitness page to show the full image
- Modified the parallax effect to only apply to the overlay image, not the background
- Improved the positioning and sizing of the overlay image for better visual appearance
- Optimized the performance by removing unnecessary animations

### Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. **Issue**: Background image was only showing 90% of its size due to incorrect CSS.
   **Solution**: Updated `background-size` from `90%` to `cover` to ensure the full image is visible.

2. **Issue**: The background image had a parallax effect which competed with the overlay animation.
   **Solution**: Removed the ScrollTrigger animation for the background while keeping it for the overlay.

3. **Issue**: Overlay image was not properly centered and had fixed pixel dimensions.
   **Solution**: Updated the positioning to use percentage-based values and `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` for better responsiveness.

### Execution Status
✅ **Successful Implementation**: The fitness page hero section now correctly displays the full background image without parallax effect, while the overlay image maintains its engaging parallax and breathing animations. This creates a better visual hierarchy and improves the overall performance.

### Technical Details

## Work Log - Doctor Image Proximity Effect (Update)

### Implemented Features
- Repositioned the doctor image to the top-left of the `.tips-main` section using `position: absolute`.
- Adjusted `z-index` to `0` to place the image behind the main container's content (like the tip cards).
- Updated `transform-origin` to `top left` for correct scaling from the new position.
- Added opacity to the image container for a subtle appearance.
- Updated JavaScript proximity logic to include a visibility check, optimizing performance by skipping calculations when the image is off-screen.

### Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. **Issue**: Image initially appeared *over* the tip cards due to fixed positioning and higher z-index.
   **Solution**: Changed `position` to `absolute` (relative to `.tips-main`), set `z-index` to `0`, and ensured `.tips-main .container` has `position: relative` and `z-index: 1`.

2. **Issue**: Proximity effect calculations running even when the image wasn't visible.
   **Solution**: Added a check using `getBoundingClientRect()` in the `mousemove` listener to see if the image is outside the viewport bounds (plus the threshold) and skip calculations if it is.

### Execution Status
✅ **Successful Implementation**: The doctor image is now positioned at the top-left, behind the main content, and the proximity effect functions correctly, including the performance optimization for visibility.

### Technical Details
- CSS `position: absolute` used for positioning within the parent section.
- `z-index: 0` on the image container and `z-index: 1` on the `.tips-main .container` ensures correct layering.
- JavaScript `getBoundingClientRect()` check added to `mousemove` listener for optimization.

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding a subtle rotation or tilt effect along with the scaling.
- Explore different easing functions for the animation.
- Implement a more specific trigger area instead of the entire document for the `mouseleave` reset.
- Make the image clickable, perhaps linking to a contact or about section.

## Work Log - Doctor Image Proximity Effect (Initial)

### Implemented Features
- Added doctor.png image to the tips page
- Positioned the image using CSS (initially fixed, bottom-right)
- Implemented a JavaScript proximity effect using GSAP:
  - The image smoothly scales up as the mouse cursor gets closer
  - The scaling effect reaches its maximum when the cursor is very close
  - The image smoothly returns to its original size when the mouse moves away
- Added responsive adjustments to hide the image on smaller screens

### Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. **Issue**: Initial CSS hover effect wasn't meeting the "proximity" requirement.
   **Solution**: Implemented a JavaScript solution using GSAP to calculate mouse distance and dynamically apply scaling.

2. **Issue**: Potential performance concerns with mousemove event listeners.
   **Solution**: Used GSAP's optimized animation handling and `overwrite: 'auto'` to manage animations efficiently. Kept calculations within the event listener lightweight.

3. **Issue**: Image could potentially overlap important content on smaller screens.
   **Solution**: Added media queries to hide the image container below 768px viewport width.

### Execution Status
✅ **Successful Implementation**: The doctor image has been added to the tips page, and the proximity scaling effect is functioning smoothly using GSAP. The image scales based on mouse distance as intended, and it is hidden on smaller screens to maintain a clean layout.

### Technical Details
- Used `getBoundingClientRect()` to get the image's position.
- Calculated Euclidean distance between mouse cursor and image center.
- Mapped the distance to a scale factor using linear interpolation.
- Used `gsap.to()` for smooth animation of the `scale` property.
- Added `mouseleave` event listener on the document to reset the scale when the mouse leaves the window.

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding a subtle rotation or tilt effect along with the scaling.
- Explore different easing functions for the animation.
- Implement a more specific trigger area instead of the entire document for the `mouseleave` reset.
- Make the image clickable, perhaps linking to a contact or about section.

   **Solution**: Added the jQuery library via CDN to ensure auth-ui.js works properly.

2. **Issue**: Missing logout button in the navigation bar.
   **Solution**: Added a logout button with appropriate classes (btn-secondary, logout-btn, hidden).

3. **Issue**: Missing CSS classes for authentication styling.
   **Solution**: Added the necessary CSS classes (.hidden, .logged-in, .logout-btn) to tips.css.

### Execution Status
✅ **Successful Implementation**: The authentication functionality has been successfully implemented in the tips page. The login button now changes to the user's last name after successful login, and a logout button appears. The functionality is consistent with the other pages of the site.

**Functions Implemented:**
- Added HTML structure for the scroll-to-top button (`#scrollToTopBtn`) in `meal-planner.html`.
- Added CSS styles for positioning, appearance (oval shape, icon treatment), visibility transition, and responsiveness for `.scroll-to-top-btn` in `css/meal-planner.css`.
- Implemented JavaScript logic (`setupScrollToTop` function in `js/meal-planner.js`):
  - Detects scroll position relative to `#recipesGrid`.
  - Toggles visibility of `#scrollToTopBtn` with a fade/slide effect.
  - Handles click event on the button to scroll smoothly to `#main-container`.

**Errors Encountered:** None.

**Error Solutions:** N/A.

**Execution Success:** Successful. The button appears/disappears based on scroll position and scrolls to the target element on click.

## Project Status Log

## Navbar Animation Fix (index.html & meal-planner.html)

- **Implemented Function:** Added consistent navbar hide/show animation (smooth fade and slide) on scroll to `index.html` and `meal-planner.html`, matching the behavior in `tips.html`.
- **Errors Encountered:**
    1.  The navbar animation logic in `js/main.js` was initially outside the `DOMContentLoaded` listener, potentially executing before the navbar element was ready.
    2.  jQuery's `.show()` and `.hide()` methods used in `js/auth-ui.js` were directly manipulating the `display` style, interfering with the CSS `opacity` transition on the navbar and its children, causing the fade effect to fail.
- **Error Solution:**
    1.  Moved the navbar scroll event listener code block inside the `DOMContentLoaded` listener in `js/main.js`.
    2.  Replaced all instances of `.show()` and `.hide()` in `js/auth-ui.js` with `.removeClass('hidden')` and `.addClass('hidden')` respectively to leverage CSS transitions properly.
- **Execution Status:** Successful. The necessary CSS transitions were already present. Both JavaScript timing and interference issues have been addressed.

## Login Button Visibility Fix

- **Implemented Function:** Ensured the "Login In" button in the navbar (on `index.html` and `meal-planner.html`) and the "Join Today" side button (on `index.html`) are hidden when a user is logged in.
- **Errors Encountered:** The buttons were missing the `hide-when-logged-in` CSS class, preventing the existing `js/auth-ui.js` logic from hiding them.
- **Error Solution:** Added the `hide-when-logged-in` class to the respective anchor tags (`<a>`) in `index.html` and `meal-planner.html`.
- **Execution Status:** Successful. The buttons should now be correctly hidden upon successful login.

## Navbar Animation Fix (GSAP Approach)

- **Implemented Function:** Refactored the navbar hide/show animation on scroll for `

## Work Log - Meal Planner Authentication Limit Feature

### Implemented Features
- Added a limit of 2 saved recipes for non-logged-in users
- Created an authentication modal that appears when a guest user tries to save more than 2 recipes
- Implemented a "Sign In" button that redirects to the login page
- Added a "Create Account" button that redirects to the login page with the signup modal showing automatically
- Modified login and signup functionality to redirect users back to the meal planner after authentication
- Added a "Continue as Guest" option to dismiss the modal

### Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. **Issue**: Need to pass information from the authentication modal to the login page to show the signup form.
   **Solution**: Added URL parameters (`?signup=true`) to control whether the signup modal should appear on the login page.

2. **Issue**: Redirecting users back to the meal planner page after login/signup.
   **Solution**: Implemented a redirect system using URL parameters and sessionStorage to store and retrieve the redirect URL.

3. **Issue**: Signup page was completely separate from login page, making the flow confusing.
   **Solution**: Modified the authentication flow to use the login page with the signup modal instead of a separate signup page.

### Execution Status
✅ **Successful Implementation**: The authentication limit feature has been successfully implemented. Non-logged-in users are now limited to saving 2 recipes, and they are prompted to sign in or create an account when they try to save more. The authentication flow is seamless, with proper redirection back to the meal planner after successful login or signup.

### Technical Details
- Used localStorage to track saved recipes across sessions
- Implemented a check in the `handleSaveRecipe` function to verify login status and recipe count
- Created a modal overlay system with clear calls-to-action
- Used URL parameters to control the signup modal visibility
- Used sessionStorage for secure and temporary storage of the redirect URL
- Added event listeners for modal interaction (close, cancel, keyboard events)

### Future Enhancements
- Implement a server-side check for recipe limits to prevent client-side manipulation
- Add a notification or badge showing how many more recipes can be saved before hitting the limit
- Implement a "premium" tier with different recipe limits
- Add social login options for quicker authentication
- Consider adding a preview of saved recipes in the authentication modal

# Work Log - Fixed Fitness Page JavaScript Error

## Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. **TypeError in fitness.js**
   - Problem: `Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'` at line 444
   - Cause: The `createProgramCard` function was returning an HTML string instead of a DOM element
   - Solution: Rewrote the function to create proper DOM elements using `document.createElement`

2. **Filter System Issues**
   - Problem: Filter tags weren't properly connected to program categories
   - Solution: Updated filter system to use data-category attributes and lowercase values for consistency

3. **Duplicate Initialization**
   - Problem: Multiple DOM content loaded event listeners causing conflicts
   - Solution: Consolidated initialization into a single flow with proper element existence checks

## Technical Details
- Changed `createProgramCard` to return HTMLElement instead of string
- Added robust error checking throughout the code
- Implemented proper null checks before accessing DOM elements
- Used the data-category attributes for filter matching
- Added 3D flip effect for program cards
- Removed duplicate initialization code

## Execution Status
✅ Error fixed successfully - the program cards now render and filter properly
✅ Filter system working correctly with proper category matching
✅ Card animations functioning with graceful fallbacks when GSAP isn't available

## Future Enhancements
1. Add sorting functionality (by difficulty, duration, etc.)
2. Implement modal view for program details when clicking on a card
3. Add save/bookmark functionality for favorite programs
4. Implement program search
5. Add user progress tracking for programs
