# Project Status - WellnessWave Website

## April 1, 2023 - Website Enhancements

### Functions Implemented
- Extracted JavaScript into separate `main.js` file in a new `js` folder
- Implemented parallax-like scroll effect where hero text moves up while background image remains fixed
- Modified About section to have equal-sized image and content areas
- Updated CSS for better responsive behavior

### Errors Encountered
- Initially, the about image and content areas had different sizes
- Hero section background was scrolling with the page content
- The fixed image background needed additional CSS properties to function correctly

### Solutions
- Used CSS grid with `grid-auto-rows: 1fr` and `align-items: stretch` to ensure equal height of about image and content
- Removed border-radius and box-shadow from about sections for a cleaner edge-to-edge look
- Added `background-attachment: fixed` to the hero section to keep background image static
- Implemented JavaScript to control the hero content movement on scroll
- Added transition properties for smoother animation

### Execution Status
- All changes have been successfully implemented
- The website now has a more dynamic feel with the scroll effects
- About section now matches the design requirements with equal-sized areas

## April 7, 2023 - Enhanced Parallax Effect

### Updates Implemented
- Fixed parallax effect issues for About and Food section images:
  - Completely revamped the parallax calculation methodology
  - Used a center-based approach to calculate image movement
  - Increased the translateY range for more noticeable effect (up to 50px)
  - Applied will-change: transform CSS property to optimize animation performance
  - Improved transition timing with ease-out for smoother movement
  - Added initial load calculation to ensure correct image positioning
- Extended the detection zone for parallax effect (200px beyond viewport)

### Issues Addressed
- Subtle parallax effect was barely noticeable on scroll
- Parallax calculation based only on visibility percentage wasn't effective
- Images needed smoother transitions for better visual effect

### Execution Status
- Successfully implemented enhanced parallax effect
- More natural and noticeable image movement as user scrolls
- Optimized performance with will-change property
- Smoother transitions with adjusted timing function 

## April 8, 2023 - Revised Parallax Effect

### Updates Implemented
- Completely revised the parallax effect for a more dramatic visual impact:
  - Implemented a "revealing" parallax effect where images shift from bottom to top during scroll
  - Modified image CSS to be 130% taller than their containers
  - Positioned images at the bottom of containers initially
  - Created smooth vertical translation as user scrolls (-30% total shift)
  - Removed transition delays to make movement directly follow scroll
- Technical improvements:
  - Simplified the parallax calculation based on section's position through viewport
  - Added position: absolute to images for proper container overflow handling
  - Optimized translation to use percentage values for better scaling

### Issues Addressed
- Previous parallax effect wasn't matching the desired visual style
- Need for a more dramatic and noticeable image movement during scroll
- Images should reveal from bottom to top as user scrolls through sections

### Execution Status
- Successfully implemented the revealing parallax effect
- Smoother, more controlled image movement that follows viewport position
- More dramatic and visually appealing scroll effect
- Improved performance with simplified calculations 

## April 9, 2023 - Fixed Background Parallax Implementation

### Updates Implemented
- Completely redesigned the parallax effect for the About and Food sections:
  - Switched from JavaScript-based translation to CSS fixed background approach
  - Converted images from `<img>` elements to CSS background images
  - Applied `background-attachment: fixed` to create true parallax effect
  - Set appropriate background-size and background-position properties
  - Removed all JavaScript parallax code for these sections
- Fixed the issue with images overflowing their containers:
  - Eliminated position absolute and custom height adjustments
  - Used overflow: hidden properly with fixed background images
  - Maintained the aspect-ratio for proper responsive behavior

### Issues Addressed
- Previous parallax approach wasn't working as expected
- Images were visibly overflowing their container elements
- JavaScript-based parallax was causing inconsistent behavior

### Execution Status
- Successfully implemented fixed background parallax
- Images now remain properly contained within their divs
- Consistent parallax effect that matches the hero section
- Simplified code by removing custom JavaScript parallax logic 

## April 11, 2023 - Background Position Parallax Implementation

### Updates Implemented
- Replaced the CSS fixed background parallax with a JavaScript-driven background-position parallax:
  - Reverted CSS changes (removed pseudo-elements, set `background-attachment: scroll`)
  - Implemented a new JavaScript function `applyBackgroundParallax`
  - This function calculates the element's position relative to the viewport center
  - It adjusts the vertical `background-position` (e.g., `center YY%`) dynamically
  - Used a parallax factor to control the intensity of the movement
  - Clamped the background position between 0% and 100% to prevent extreme values
- Ensured images display correctly within their containers:
  - Background images now move naturally *within* their divs
  - Solved the issue of images appearing zoomed or incorrectly cropped
  - Added null checks in JS for robustness

### Issues Addressed
- Fixed background approach (`background-attachment: fixed`) caused incorrect image display/cropping within grid containers.
- Images appeared too large or showed the wrong section.
- Need for a parallax effect where the background moves relative to its container during scroll.

### Execution Status
- Successfully implemented background-position parallax using JavaScript.
- Images now display correctly and are properly contained.
- Smooth parallax effect achieved by adjusting background position.
- Code is more robust and provides the desired visual effect.

## 2023-10-27: Parallax Reveal Direction Fix

*   **Implemented Functions:**
    *   Reversed the GSAP `fromTo` animation for the section image reveal effect in `js/main.js`. Changed the `yPercent` animation range from `{ 0 } -> { -60 }` to `{ -60 } -> { 0 }`.
*   **Encountered Errors:** User reported the parallax reveal direction was opposite to the desired effect (showing top->middle->bottom instead of bottom->middle->top). A blank space was also visible under images during scroll.
*   **Error Solutions:** Corrected the `yPercent` animation start and end values in the GSAP `fromTo` function.
*   **Execution Status:** Successful. Animation direction fixed. User testing pending.

## 2023-10-27: Parallax Speed Adjustment & Code Cleanup

*   **Implemented Functions:**
    *   Adjusted the `scrub` value in the section image parallax ScrollTrigger in `js/main.js` from `true` to `0.5` to slightly increase responsiveness.
    *   Removed commented-out and unused CSS rules/properties from `css/styles.css` related to previous parallax attempts.
*   **Encountered Errors:** None. Changes based on user request for speed adjustment and code tidiness.
*   **Error Solutions:** N/A.
*   **Execution Status:** Successful. Speed adjusted and CSS cleaned. Project phase complete.
