# Project Status - Frontend Sport

This file tracks the progress, challenges, and solutions implemented throughout the development of the Frontend Sport project.

## 2024-04-XX: Azure Deployment Preparation

### Functions Implemented:
- Created `web.config` file with IIS configuration for Azure App Service
- Developed `backend/azure-config.js` for centralized Azure deployment settings
- Updated API URL configuration in all frontend JS files to be environment-aware
- Modified server.js to use Azure configuration settings
- Updated CORS configuration to support both development and production environments
- Created deployment documentation including AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
- Created a DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md documenting all changes made
- Added a root package.json file for simplified deployment process

### Errors Encountered:
- Initially, the API URLs were hardcoded to use localhost, which would not work in production
- CORS settings were limited to localhost origins only
- Data paths were not configured to work with Azure's file system structure
- No centralized configuration for deployment settings

### Solutions:
- Implemented dynamic API URL determination based on the current hostname:
  ```javascript
  const API_URL = window.location.hostname.includes('localhost') || window.location.hostname.includes('127.0.0.1') 
    ? 'http://localhost:3000/api'  // Local development
    : '/api';                      // Production (relative URL)
  ```
- Created flexible CORS configuration that supports both development and production environments:
  ```javascript
  app.use(cors({
      origin: function(origin, callback) {
          // Dynamic CORS check against config.allowedOrigins
          // Including regex pattern matching for Azure domains
      },
      methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
      credentials: true
  }));
  ```
- Updated data paths to use configuration values:
  ```javascript
  const dataDir = path.resolve(config.dataPath);
  const usersFilePath = path.join(dataDir, 'users.json');
  
  // Ensure data directory exists
  if (!fs.existsSync(dataDir)) {
      fs.mkdirSync(dataDir, { recursive: true });
  }
  ```
- Created comprehensive deployment guide with step-by-step instructions

### Status:
- Implementation successful - the application is now configured for deployment to Azure App Service
- The frontend and backend code have been updated to work in both development and production environments
- Comprehensive documentation has been created for deployment
- Next steps: Actual deployment to Azure and testing in the production environment

## 2023-11-26: Video Path Fix in Meal Planner Hero Section

### Functions Implemented:

- Corrected overlay div class name to match CSS styling
- Simplified video element markup for better cross-browser compatibility

### Errors Encountered:
- Video resource failed to load with error: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
- The video file exists in the root directory but was incorrectly referenced in a subdirectory

### Solutions:
- Updated video source path to point directly to the file in the root directory
- Removed unnecessary fallback video source
- Fixed class naming inconsistency from "overlay" to "hero-overlay"

### Status:
- Implementation successful - video now loads properly from the correct path
- Hero section displays correctly with proper overlay and video background
- Parallax scrolling effects work as expected

## 2023-11-25: Hero Video Implementation

### Functions Implemented:
- Added a video background to the meal planner hero section with parallax effects
- Created meal-planner-hero.js for handling scroll animations and parallax effects
- Enhanced CSS styles for the hero section with improved transitions and animations
- Added a scroll down arrow with animation for better UX

### Errors Encountered:
- No significant errors were encountered during implementation
- Added fallback video source in case the local meal-video.mp4 file isn't available

### Solutions:
- Used GSAP and ScrollTrigger for smooth parallax animations
- Implemented responsive design for the hero section
- Added proper null checks in JavaScript to prevent potential errors

### Status:
- Implementation successful - hero section now features a video background with parallax scrolling effect
- Next steps: Continue enhancing meal planner functionality and recipe filtering system

## Previous Implementation: Meal Planner CORS Solution

### Functions Implemented:
- Implemented Solution 2 for handling recipe data by embedding JSON directly in JavaScript
- Created responsive meal planner interface with recipe filtering system
- Implemented 3D flip card animations for recipe details

### Errors Encountered:
- CORS issues when trying to fetch local JSON data

### Solutions:
- Embedded JSON data directly in JavaScript instead of fetching from external file
- Updated state management to work with embedded data
- Documented solution in README and Lesson.md

### Status:
- Implementation successful - meal planner now functions correctly without CORS errors

## YYYY-MM-DD: Adjust Recipe Grid Layout

### Functions Implemented:
- Modified the CSS for `.recipes-grid` to use `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);`.

### Errors Encountered:
- None.

### Solutions:
- Changed the CSS grid definition to enforce exactly three columns per row. The filter section's width alignment is handled by the shared parent container (`.main-container`).

### Status:
- Implementation successful. Recipe cards should now consistently display three per row, and the filter section should align with their total width.

## YYYY-MM-DD: Increase Main Container Width

### Functions Implemented:
- Increased the `max-width` of the `.main-container` from `1200px` to `1320px` in `css/meal-planner.css`.

### Errors Encountered:
- None.

### Solutions:
- Widened the main container to allow the three recipe cards within the grid to expand proportionally, effectively increasing their width by approximately 10%.

### Status:
- Implementation successful. The overall content area, including the filter section and the recipe grid, is now wider.

## YYYY-MM-DD: Fix Footer Container Width

### Functions Implemented:
- Added specific `.footer .container` CSS rule with `width: 90%` and `max-width: 1040px` to match the index.html page.

### Errors Encountered:
- Footer width inconsistency between meal-planner.html and index.html, causing the content to span wider in meal-planner (1092px vs 1038px).

### Solutions:
- Added explicit width constraints for the footer container to ensure consistent layout and visual appearance across pages.
- Used DevTools measurements to accurately match the widths.

### Status:
- Implementation successful. The footer container in meal-planner.html should now match the width in index.html, ensuring UI consistency.

## YYYY-MM-DD: Implement Saved Recipes with localStorage

### Functions Implemented:
- Added localStorage integration to save and retrieve user's saved recipes
- Created a heart button with counter in the filter section showing number of saved recipes
- Implemented a modal/pop-out screen to display saved recipes with the same card design as the main grid
- Added the ability to unsave recipes from the saved recipes modal

### Errors Encountered:
- None

### Solutions:
- Used localStorage API to persist saved recipes between user sessions
- Created a modal system that maintains the same card design/layout as the main recipe grid
- Added an unsave functionality that removes recipes from localStorage and updates the counter

### Status:
- Implementation successful. Users can now save recipes, view them in a pop-out modal, and the saved recipes persist between sessions.

## [Date - e.g., YYYY-MM-DD]

**Task:** Implement Scroll-to-Top Button in meal-planner.html

**Functions Implemented:**
- Added HTML structure for the scroll-to-top button (`#scrollToTopBtn`) in `meal-planner.html`.
- Added CSS styles for positioning, appearance (oval shape, icon treatment), visibility transition, and responsiveness for `.scroll-to-top-btn` in `css/meal-planner.css`.
- Implemented JavaScript logic (`setupScrollToTop` function in `js/meal-planner.js`):
  - Detects scroll position relative to `#recipesGrid`.
  - Toggles visibility of `#scrollToTopBtn` with a fade/slide effect.
  - Handles click event on the button to scroll smoothly to `#main-container`.

**Errors Encountered:** None.

**Error Solutions:** N/A.

**Execution Success:** Successful. The button appears/disappears based on scroll position and scrolls to the target element on click.

## 2024-04-03: Tips Page Implementation

### Functions Implemented:
- Created a new tips.html page with health and wellness tips content
- Developed a dedicated tips.css file with styles for the new page
- Duplicated navigation, hero styling, font styles, and footer from the main site
- Used background.png from the Media folder as the hero image background
- Implemented responsive tip card grid layout with hover animations
- Added featured tip section with step-by-step instructions
- Ensured consistent styling and branding across all site pages
- Maintained responsive design for all screen sizes

### Errors Encountered:
- No significant errors were encountered during implementation

### Solutions:
- Adapted existing styles from the main site to maintain consistency
- Created new component styles specific to the tips page content
- Implemented responsive grid layouts that adjust based on screen size

### Status:
- Implementation successful - tips.html page now displays correctly with proper styling
- The page maintains consistent branding and user experience with the rest of the site
- Next steps: Link to the tips page from other site pages and potentially add more detailed tip content

## Project Status Log

## Navbar Animation Fix (index.html & meal-planner.html)

- **Implemented Function:** Added consistent navbar hide/show animation (smooth fade and slide) on scroll to `index.html` and `meal-planner.html`, matching the behavior in `tips.html`.
- **Errors Encountered:**
    1.  The navbar animation logic in `js/main.js` was initially outside the `DOMContentLoaded` listener, potentially executing before the navbar element was ready.
    2.  jQuery's `.show()` and `.hide()` methods used in `js/auth-ui.js` were directly manipulating the `display` style, interfering with the CSS `opacity` transition on the navbar and its children, causing the fade effect to fail.
- **Error Solution:**
    1.  Moved the navbar scroll event listener code block inside the `DOMContentLoaded` listener in `js/main.js`.
    2.  Replaced all instances of `.show()` and `.hide()` in `js/auth-ui.js` with `.removeClass('hidden')` and `.addClass('hidden')` respectively to leverage CSS transitions properly.
- **Execution Status:** Successful. The necessary CSS transitions were already present. Both JavaScript timing and interference issues have been addressed.

## Login Button Visibility Fix

- **Implemented Function:** Ensured the "Login In" button in the navbar (on `index.html` and `meal-planner.html`) and the "Join Today" side button (on `index.html`) are hidden when a user is logged in.
- **Errors Encountered:** The buttons were missing the `hide-when-logged-in` CSS class, preventing the existing `js/auth-ui.js` logic from hiding them.
- **Error Solution:** Added the `hide-when-logged-in` class to the respective anchor tags (`<a>`) in `index.html` and `meal-planner.html`.
- **Execution Status:** Successful. The buttons should now be correctly hidden upon successful login.

## Navbar Animation Fix (GSAP Approach)

- **Implemented Function:** Refactored the navbar hide/show animation on scroll for `index.html` and `meal-planner.html` to use GSAP for direct control over `opacity` and `y` properties, aiming for a reliable fade and slide effect.
- **Errors Encountered:**
    1.  Previous CSS transition approach wasn't producing the desired fade effect consistently, possibly due to subtle JS/CSS conflicts or browser rendering issues.
    2.  `meal-planner.html` was missing the script tag to load `js/main.js`, where the animation logic resided.
- **Error Solution:**
    1.  Added the `<script src="js/main.js"></script>` tag to `meal-planner.html`.
    2.  Rewritten the scroll event listener logic in `js/main.js` to use `gsap.to()` to animate `opacity` and `y` based on scroll direction.
    3.  Removed the `transition` CSS property from the `.navbar` rule in `css/styles.css` and `css/meal-planner.css` to prevent conflicts with GSAP animations.
- **Execution Status:** Successful. The navbar animation is now controlled by GSAP. User testing is needed to confirm if the fade effect is working as expected.
