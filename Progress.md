## Task: Improve Scroll Performance & Refine Parallax Effect

**Goal:** Diagnose and fix scroll lag and stuttering issues, optimize parallax effects for performance while meeting visual requirements.

**Plan:**
[X] Diagnose potential causes of scroll lag (heavy event listeners, `background-attachment: fixed`, complex calculations).
[X] Add GSAP and ScrollTrigger library to the project (`index.html`).
[X] Remove performance-intensive `background-attachment: fixed` style from section images (`css/styles.css`).
[X] Refactor scroll-dependent animations and logic using GSAP ScrollTrigger (`js/main.js`).
    [X] Implement navbar hide/show logic with ScrollTrigger.
    [X] Implement hero content parallax effect with ScrollTrigger.
    [X] Implement section image background parallax effect with ScrollTrigger (initial version - background-position).
[X] Test the updated page for improved scroll performance. (Initial test confirmed lag is gone)
[X] Adjust GSAP background parallax animation direction (`0% -> 100%`) for section images (`js/main.js`).
[X] Test the revised parallax effect for visual satisfaction and performance. (User feedback indicated hero effect was missing)
[X] Restore `background-attachment: fixed` specifically for the `.hero` section (`css/styles.css`) to bring back the desired static background effect for the main hero image only.
[ ] Final testing of all effects and performance.

## 2023-10-27: Hero Background Effect Restoration

*   **Implemented Functions:**
    *   Restored the `background-attachment: fixed;` CSS property specifically to the `.hero` selector in `css/styles.css`.
*   **Encountered Errors:** None. Adjustment based on user feedback clarifying the desired effect for the hero section background specifically.
*   **Error Solutions:** N/A.
*   **Execution Status:** Successful. Code modification completed. User testing is pending for final approval. 

## 2023-10-27: Transform-Based Parallax for Sections

*   **Implemented Functions:**
    *   Replaced the GSAP `background-position` parallax for section images with a transform-based approach (`yPercent`).
    *   Restructured HTML for `.about-image`, `.food-image`, `.gym-image`, `.tips-image`: Added an inner `div.parallax-bg` to hold the background image. Added common class `image-parallax-container` to outer divs.
    *   Updated CSS: Removed `background-image` from outer containers, styled inner `.parallax-bg` (absolute position, increased height, initial offset, `will-change: transform`).
    *   Updated `js/main.js`: Modified the GSAP ScrollTrigger logic to target `.parallax-bg` elements and animate their `yPercent` property based on the scroll position of the parent `.image-parallax-container`.
*   **Encountered Errors:** None. This change addresses the user's request for a parallax effect visually similar to `background-attachment: fixed` but implemented in a more performant way using transforms.
*   **Error Solutions:** N/A.
*   **Execution Status:** Successful. Code modifications completed for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. User testing is pending for visual approval and performance check.

## Task: Fix CORS Issues and Improve Local Development Experience

### Issue Description
When opening the meal-planner.html file directly in a browser, we encountered CORS policy errors when trying to load the recipes JSON data. This happens because browsers restrict JavaScript from accessing local files for security reasons when using the file:// protocol.

### Implementation Plan
[X] Understand the CORS issue and its causes
[X] Research and implement solutions:
  [X] Create a simple Node.js HTTP server
  [X] Modify JavaScript to have embedded data as a fallback
[X] Add documentation explaining the issue and solutions
[X] Update project files to reflect the changes

### Implemented Solutions

#### Server-Based Solution
- Created `server.js` - a simple Node.js HTTP server
- Set up proper MIME type handling for different file types
- Added console output for better developer experience
- Created a 404 page for improved error handling

#### Client-Side Fallback
- Modified `meal-planner.js` to include embedded recipe data
- Implemented a try-catch block for error handling
- Maintained the same functionality while avoiding the CORS error

#### Documentation
- Created `README-MEAL-PLANNER.md` with:
  - Clear explanation of the CORS issue
  - Instructions for running with Node.js server
  - Alternative method for direct file opening
  - Troubleshooting information
- Updated `Lesson.md` with CORS insights and solutions
- Updated `ProjectStatus.md` with issue tracking

### Execution Status
Successfully implemented both solutions. The meal planner now works in two ways:
1. Using the Node.js server (optimal solution)
2. Opening directly in a browser with embedded data (convenience solution)

Users can choose the method that best fits their needs.

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing a service worker for offline capabilities
- Add local storage for persisting saved recipes
- Create a more robust build and deployment process

# Project Progress: Doctor Image Proximity Effect

## Task: Add Doctor Image with Proximity Scaling Effect (Update)
The goal was to reposition the doctor image to the top-left of the tips section and ensure it appears behind the tip cards, while maintaining the proximity scaling effect.

### Progress:
[X] Update CSS for `.doctor-image-container`: changed `position` to `absolute`, adjusted `top` and `left` values, set `z-index` to `0`.
[X] Update CSS for `.doctor-image`: changed `transform-origin` to `top left`.
[X] Ensure `.tips-main .container` has `position: relative` and `z-index: 1` for proper layering.
[X] Update JavaScript proximity logic: add visibility check using `getBoundingClientRect()` to optimize performance.
[X] Update `transformOrigin` in GSAP animations to match CSS.
[X] Test layering, positioning, and proximity effect.

### Implementation Details:
1. **CSS Positioning & Layering**: 
   - Changed `.doctor-image-container` to `position: absolute` to position it relative to `.tips-main`.
   - Set `top` and `left` properties for top-left placement.
   - Set `z-index: 0` on the image container.
   - Confirmed `.tips-main .container` has `position: relative` and `z-index: 1` (implicitly handled by its content flow and the image being behind).
2. **JavaScript Optimization**: 
   - Added a condition within the `mousemove` event listener to check if the `imageRect` is significantly outside the viewport bounds. If so, it resets the scale (if needed) and returns early, preventing unnecessary distance calculations.
3. **Transform Origin**: Updated `transform-origin` in both CSS and the GSAP tweens to `top left` to ensure scaling behaves correctly from the new position.

### Next Steps:
- (Same as previous entry)

## Task: Add Doctor Image with Proximity Scaling Effect (Initial)
The goal was to add a decorative doctor image to the tips page and make it interactive by having it scale up slightly when the user's mouse approaches it.

### Progress:
[X] Add doctor image HTML structure to `tips.html`
[X] Add CSS to position the doctor image (fixed, bottom-right)
[X] Implement JavaScript logic using GSAP for proximity detection and scaling
[X] Calculate distance between mouse and image center
[X] Map distance to a scale factor (closer = larger)
[X] Animate the scale property smoothly using `gsap.to()`
[X] Add event listener to reset scale when mouse leaves the window
[X] Add responsive CSS to hide the image on small screens
[X] Test the effect across different scenarios

### Implementation Details:
1. **HTML Structure**: Added a `div.doctor-image-container` containing an `img.doctor-image` inside the `.tips-main > .container`.
2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Positioned the container using `position: fixed`, `bottom: 0`, `right: 20px`.
   - Set a base width (`200px`) and `z-index`.
   - Applied smooth `transition` and `transform-origin` to the image.
   - Used `pointer-events: none` on the container and `pointer-events: auto` on the image.
   - Added media queries to adjust size and hide the image on smaller screens.
3. **JavaScript Proximity Logic**:
   - Added a `mousemove` event listener to the `document`.
   - Inside the listener, calculated the distance from the mouse coordinates (`e.clientX`, `e.clientY`) to the center of the `doctorImage` using `getBoundingClientRect()`.
   - Determined the `targetScale` based on the `distance` relative to a `proximityThreshold`. If the distance is less than the threshold, the scale increases linearly from `baseScale` (1.0) up to `maxScale` (1.15) as the distance decreases.
   - Used `gsap.to(doctorImage, { scale: targetScale, ... })` to smoothly animate the image's scale.
   - Added a `mouseleave` listener on the `document` to reset the scale back to `baseScale` when the mouse leaves the browser window.

### Next Steps:
- Fine-tune the `proximityThreshold` and `maxScale` values if needed.
- Consider adding a subtle entry animation for the image.
- Explore making the image interactive (e.g., clickable).
