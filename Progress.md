## April 8, 2023 - Revealing Parallax Effect

### Task Description
Revise the parallax effect for the About and Food section images to create a "revealing" effect where images move from showing their bottom portion to their top portion as the user scrolls.

### Plan
[X] Analyze the reference images to understand the desired effect
[X] Modify the CSS to make images taller than their containers
[X] Position images at the bottom of containers initially
[X] Implement JavaScript logic to translate images vertically as user scrolls
[X] Remove transition delays for direct scroll following
[X] Test the scroll effect at various speeds and viewport positions
[X] Update documentation in ProjectStatus.md

### Implementation Notes
- Made images 130% the height of their containers to allow for vertical movement
- Used position: absolute and bottom: 0 to position images at container bottom initially
- Calculated progress through viewport (0 to 1) as user scrolls
- Applied vertical translation from 0% to -30% based on scroll progress
- Used percentage values for translation to maintain proper scaling on different screen sizes
- Removed transition duration to make movement directly follow scroll position

### Next Steps

## April 11, 2023 - Background Position Parallax Implementation

### Task Description
Implement a JavaScript-driven parallax effect by adjusting the `background-position` property to fix issues with image display and containment caused by the `background-attachment: fixed` method.

### Plan
[X] Revert CSS changes related to fixed backgrounds and pseudo-elements.
[X] Implement a JavaScript function to calculate element position relative to viewport center.
[X] Dynamically adjust the vertical `background-position` based on scroll.
[X] Add throttling and clamping for performance and stability.
[X] Test thoroughly to ensure correct image display and smooth effect.
[X] Update documentation in ProjectStatus.md.

### Implementation Notes
- The `background-attachment: fixed` approach is problematic for elements within scrolling containers or grids.
- Adjusting `background-position` with JavaScript provides more control over parallax within a specific element.
- Calculated offset based on the difference between viewport center and element center.
- Used a `parallaxFactor` (0.1) to control the intensity â€“ adjust as needed.
- Clamped values between 0% and 100% to prevent the background from moving too far.

### Next Steps
- Add testimonials section.
- Implement contact form functionality.
- Create a gallery of fitness activities.
- Add smooth scroll behavior for navigation links.

## Task: Improve Scroll Performance & Refine Parallax Effect

**Goal:** Diagnose and fix scroll lag and stuttering issues, optimize parallax effects for performance while meeting visual requirements.

**Plan:**
[X] Diagnose potential causes of scroll lag (heavy event listeners, `background-attachment: fixed`, complex calculations).
[X] Add GSAP and ScrollTrigger library to the project (`index.html`).
[X] Remove performance-intensive `background-attachment: fixed` style from section images (`css/styles.css`).
[X] Refactor scroll-dependent animations and logic using GSAP ScrollTrigger (`js/main.js`).
    [X] Implement navbar hide/show logic with ScrollTrigger.
    [X] Implement hero content parallax effect with ScrollTrigger.
    [X] Implement section image background parallax effect with ScrollTrigger (initial version - background-position).
[X] Test the updated page for improved scroll performance. (Initial test confirmed lag is gone)
[X] Adjust GSAP background parallax animation direction (`0% -> 100%`) for section images (`js/main.js`).
[X] Test the revised parallax effect for visual satisfaction and performance. (User feedback indicated hero effect was missing)
[X] Restore `background-attachment: fixed` specifically for the `.hero` section (`css/styles.css`) to bring back the desired static background effect for the main hero image only.
[ ] Final testing of all effects and performance.

## 2023-10-27: Hero Background Effect Restoration

*   **Implemented Functions:**
    *   Restored the `background-attachment: fixed;` CSS property specifically to the `.hero` selector in `css/styles.css`.
*   **Encountered Errors:** None. Adjustment based on user feedback clarifying the desired effect for the hero section background specifically.
*   **Error Solutions:** N/A.
*   **Execution Status:** Successful. Code modification completed. User testing is pending for final approval. 

## 2023-10-27: Transform-Based Parallax for Sections

*   **Implemented Functions:**
    *   Replaced the GSAP `background-position` parallax for section images with a transform-based approach (`yPercent`).
    *   Restructured HTML for `.about-image`, `.food-image`, `.gym-image`, `.tips-image`: Added an inner `div.parallax-bg` to hold the background image. Added common class `image-parallax-container` to outer divs.
    *   Updated CSS: Removed `background-image` from outer containers, styled inner `.parallax-bg` (absolute position, increased height, initial offset, `will-change: transform`).
    *   Updated `js/main.js`: Modified the GSAP ScrollTrigger logic to target `.parallax-bg` elements and animate their `yPercent` property based on the scroll position of the parent `.image-parallax-container`.
*   **Encountered Errors:** None. This change addresses the user's request for a parallax effect visually similar to `background-attachment: fixed` but implemented in a more performant way using transforms.
*   **Error Solutions:** N/A.
*   **Execution Status:** Successful. Code modifications completed for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. User testing is pending for visual approval and performance check.

## Task: Fix CORS Issues and Improve Local Development Experience

### Issue Description
When opening the meal-planner.html file directly in a browser, we encountered CORS policy errors when trying to load the recipes JSON data. This happens because browsers restrict JavaScript from accessing local files for security reasons when using the file:// protocol.

### Implementation Plan
[X] Understand the CORS issue and its causes
[X] Research and implement solutions:
  [X] Create a simple Node.js HTTP server
  [X] Modify JavaScript to have embedded data as a fallback
[X] Add documentation explaining the issue and solutions
[X] Update project files to reflect the changes

### Implemented Solutions

#### Server-Based Solution
- Created `server.js` - a simple Node.js HTTP server
- Set up proper MIME type handling for different file types
- Added console output for better developer experience
- Created a 404 page for improved error handling

#### Client-Side Fallback
- Modified `meal-planner.js` to include embedded recipe data
- Implemented a try-catch block for error handling
- Maintained the same functionality while avoiding the CORS error

#### Documentation
- Created `README-MEAL-PLANNER.md` with:
  - Clear explanation of the CORS issue
  - Instructions for running with Node.js server
  - Alternative method for direct file opening
  - Troubleshooting information
- Updated `Lesson.md` with CORS insights and solutions
- Updated `ProjectStatus.md` with issue tracking

### Execution Status
Successfully implemented both solutions. The meal planner now works in two ways:
1. Using the Node.js server (optimal solution)
2. Opening directly in a browser with embedded data (convenience solution)

Users can choose the method that best fits their needs.

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing a service worker for offline capabilities
- Add local storage for persisting saved recipes
- Create a more robust build and deployment process
