## April 11, 2023 - Background Position Parallax Implementation

### Task Description
Implement a JavaScript-driven parallax effect by adjusting the `background-position` property to fix issues with image display and containment caused by the `background-attachment: fixed` method.

### Plan
[X] Revert CSS changes related to fixed backgrounds and pseudo-elements.
[X] Implement a JavaScript function to calculate element position relative to viewport center.
[X] Dynamically adjust the vertical `background-position` based on scroll.
[X] Add throttling and clamping for performance and stability.
[X] Test thoroughly to ensure correct image display and smooth effect.
[X] Update documentation in ProjectStatus.md.

### Implementation Notes
- The `background-attachment: fixed` approach is problematic for elements within scrolling containers or grids.
- Adjusting `background-position` with JavaScript provides more control over parallax within a specific element.
- Calculated offset based on the difference between viewport center and element center.
- Used a `parallaxFactor` (0.1) to control the intensity â€“ adjust as needed.
- Clamped values between 0% and 100% to prevent the background from moving too far.

### Next Steps
- Add testimonials section.
- Implement contact form functionality.
- Create a gallery of fitness activities.
- Add smooth scroll behavior for navigation links.

## April 10, 2023 - Fixed Background Position Refinement

### Task Description
Refine the fixed background position parallax implementation to ensure smooth and consistent parallax effects across different screen sizes.

### Plan
[X] Analyze the current implementation and identify areas for improvement
[X] Adjust the parallaxFactor to better control the intensity of the parallax effect
[X] Test the effect across different screen sizes and viewport positions
[X] Update documentation in ProjectStatus.md

### Implementation Notes
- The current parallaxFactor was too high, causing the background to move too far
- Adjusted the parallaxFactor to 0.05 for a more subtle and consistent parallax effect
- Tested the effect across different screen sizes and viewport positions

### Next Steps
- Add testimonials section
- Implement contact form functionality
- Create a gallery of fitness activities
- Add smooth scroll behavior for navigation links
