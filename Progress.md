## April 8, 2023 - Revealing Parallax Effect

### Task Description
Revise the parallax effect for the About and Food section images to create a "revealing" effect where images move from showing their bottom portion to their top portion as the user scrolls.

### Plan
[X] Analyze the reference images to understand the desired effect
[X] Modify the CSS to make images taller than their containers
[X] Position images at the bottom of containers initially
[X] Implement JavaScript logic to translate images vertically as user scrolls
[X] Remove transition delays for direct scroll following
[X] Test the scroll effect at various speeds and viewport positions
[X] Update documentation in ProjectStatus.md

### Implementation Notes
- Made images 130% the height of their containers to allow for vertical movement
- Used position: absolute and bottom: 0 to position images at container bottom initially
- Calculated progress through viewport (0 to 1) as user scrolls
- Applied vertical translation from 0% to -30% based on scroll progress
- Used percentage values for translation to maintain proper scaling on different screen sizes
- Removed transition duration to make movement directly follow scroll position

### Next Steps
- Consider adding testimonials section
- Implement contact form functionality
- Create a gallery of fitness activities
- Add smooth scroll behavior for navigation links

## April 7, 2023 - Enhanced Parallax Effect

### Task Description
Fix and enhance the parallax effect for the About and Food section images to create a more noticeable and smooth scrolling experience.

### Plan
[X] Analyze the current parallax implementation and identify issues
[X] Redesign the calculation method for more effective image movement 
[X] Enhance CSS transitions for smoother animations
[X] Optimize performance with will-change property
[X] Test across different scroll speeds and viewport positions
[X] Update documentation in ProjectStatus.md

### Implementation Notes
- Previous approach using visiblePercentage wasn't creating an effective parallax effect
- New approach uses section's center position relative to viewport center
- Extended detection zone (200px beyond viewport) ensures smoother transition in/out
- Clamped the percentage between -0.5 and 0.5 for controlled movement
- Added an initial call to handleParallaxEffects() to ensure correct positioning on page load

### Next Steps
- Consider adding more sections to the website (possibly testimonials)
- Implement contact form functionality
- Create a gallery of fitness activities
- Add smooth scroll behavior for navigation links

## April 6, 2023 - Flexible Sizing Implementation

### Task Description
Implement a more flexible sizing approach for the About and Food sections to address issues with fixed heights and improve responsiveness across different screen sizes.

### Plan
[X] Remove fixed height and minimum height constraints from About and Food sections
[X] Implement aspect-ratio for images to maintain proper proportions
[X] Adjust padding and spacing for better content flow
[X] Update the parallax effect JavaScript to work with the new flexible layout
[X] Update documentation in ProjectStatus.md

### Implementation Notes
- Using aspect-ratio instead of fixed heights provides better flexibility
- Improved JavaScript parallax effect with getBoundingClientRect() for more accurate viewport detection
- Added performance improvements with throttling and requestAnimationFrame
- Created a reusable handleSectionParallax function to reduce code duplication

### Next Steps
- Consider adding more sections to the website
- Implement contact form functionality
- Add testimonials section
- Create a gallery of fitness activities

## April 11, 2023 - Background Position Parallax Implementation

### Task Description
Implement a JavaScript-driven parallax effect by adjusting the `background-position` property to fix issues with image display and containment caused by the `background-attachment: fixed` method.

### Plan
[X] Revert CSS changes related to fixed backgrounds and pseudo-elements.
[X] Implement a JavaScript function to calculate element position relative to viewport center.
[X] Dynamically adjust the vertical `background-position` based on scroll.
[X] Add throttling and clamping for performance and stability.
[X] Test thoroughly to ensure correct image display and smooth effect.
[X] Update documentation in ProjectStatus.md.

### Implementation Notes
- The `background-attachment: fixed` approach is problematic for elements within scrolling containers or grids.
- Adjusting `background-position` with JavaScript provides more control over parallax within a specific element.
- Calculated offset based on the difference between viewport center and element center.
- Used a `parallaxFactor` (0.1) to control the intensity â€“ adjust as needed.
- Clamped values between 0% and 100% to prevent the background from moving too far.

### Next Steps
- Add testimonials section.
- Implement contact form functionality.
- Create a gallery of fitness activities.
- Add smooth scroll behavior for navigation links.

## April 10, 2023 - Fixed Background Position Refinement

### Task Description
Refine the fixed background position parallax implementation to ensure smooth and consistent parallax effects across different screen sizes.

### Plan
[X] Analyze the current implementation and identify areas for improvement
[X] Adjust the parallaxFactor to better control the intensity of the parallax effect
[X] Test the effect across different screen sizes and viewport positions
[X] Update documentation in ProjectStatus.md

### Implementation Notes
- The current parallaxFactor was too high, causing the background to move too far
- Adjusted the parallaxFactor to 0.05 for a more subtle and consistent parallax effect
- Tested the effect across different screen sizes and viewport positions

### Next Steps
- Add testimonials section
- Implement contact form functionality
- Create a gallery of fitness activities
- Add smooth scroll behavior for navigation links

## Task: Improve Scroll Performance & Refine Parallax Effect

**Goal:** Diagnose and fix scroll lag and stuttering issues, optimize parallax effects for performance while meeting visual requirements.

**Plan:**
[X] Diagnose potential causes of scroll lag (heavy event listeners, `background-attachment: fixed`, complex calculations).
[X] Add GSAP and ScrollTrigger library to the project (`index.html`).
[X] Remove performance-intensive `background-attachment: fixed` style from section images (`css/styles.css`).
[X] Refactor scroll-dependent animations and logic using GSAP ScrollTrigger (`js/main.js`).
    [X] Implement navbar hide/show logic with ScrollTrigger.
    [X] Implement hero content parallax effect with ScrollTrigger.
    [X] Implement section image background parallax effect with ScrollTrigger (initial version - background-position).
[X] Test the updated page for improved scroll performance. (Initial test confirmed lag is gone)
[X] Adjust GSAP background parallax animation direction (`0% -> 100%`) for section images (`js/main.js`).
[X] Test the revised parallax effect for visual satisfaction and performance. (User feedback indicated hero effect was missing)
[X] Restore `background-attachment: fixed` specifically for the `.hero` section (`css/styles.css`) to bring back the desired static background effect for the main hero image only.
[ ] Final testing of all effects and performance.

## 2023-10-27: Hero Background Effect Restoration

*   **Implemented Functions:**
    *   Restored the `background-attachment: fixed;` CSS property specifically to the `.hero` selector in `css/styles.css`.
*   **Encountered Errors:** None. Adjustment based on user feedback clarifying the desired effect for the hero section background specifically.
*   **Error Solutions:** N/A.
*   **Execution Status:** Successful. Code modification completed. User testing is pending for final approval. 

## 2023-10-27: Transform-Based Parallax for Sections

*   **Implemented Functions:**
    *   Replaced the GSAP `background-position` parallax for section images with a transform-based approach (`yPercent`).
    *   Restructured HTML for `.about-image`, `.food-image`, `.gym-image`, `.tips-image`: Added an inner `div.parallax-bg` to hold the background image. Added common class `image-parallax-container` to outer divs.
    *   Updated CSS: Removed `background-image` from outer containers, styled inner `.parallax-bg` (absolute position, increased height, initial offset, `will-change: transform`).
    *   Updated `js/main.js`: Modified the GSAP ScrollTrigger logic to target `.parallax-bg` elements and animate their `yPercent` property based on the scroll position of the parent `.image-parallax-container`.
*   **Encountered Errors:** None. This change addresses the user's request for a parallax effect visually similar to `background-attachment: fixed` but implemented in a more performant way using transforms.
*   **Error Solutions:** N/A.
*   **Execution Status:** Successful. Code modifications completed for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. User testing is pending for visual approval and performance check.
